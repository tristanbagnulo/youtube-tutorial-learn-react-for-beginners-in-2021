# Foreword by Tristan Bagnulo

I built this project the learn the React frontend framework and decided that whilst building it, I would build my own React fundamentals tutorial out of this repository. So, I have separated the project into multiple branches so that each branch pertains to a different topic or set of topics. I figured that separating the code in this way improves its readability because only the code relevant to the given topic will be in that branch. In this way, the lessons are mutually exclusive and will be less likely to confuse the reader. If you are going through this React tutorial, checkout one branch at a time to view that topic's code and inline code documentation (aka "code comments"). Think of them as separate chapters in a textbook.

Further, in aims to extract more useful information and to help you understand how code syntax produces an outcome I sometimes code the same thing in different ways and clearly separate the different implementations of the desired result for the reader to be able to attribute different syntax styles to a given outcome. 

By reflecting on my building of this project I was able to once again appreciate a principle that I had previously believed in and which I had implemented in my learning in the past. The principle is that you learn something very well when you try to teach it to someone else who you assume doesn't know much about it. By writing the code in this repo for someone else to use as their only source on beginner React principles; as clearly as possible and with concise inline documentation, I was able to review and even critique my own knowledge that I had just acquired which then allowed me to identify gaps in my knowledge and therefore, where to focus subsequent re-learning. Consequently, my knowledge of React was improved in conciseness, overall correctness and my rate of recall was faster. 

However, my learning of React, will not be completed by building this tutorial alone. I must afterwards complete multiple React projects which implement the methods and principles that I was exposed to whilst creating this repo. I plan to refer to this repo whilst building these projects.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
