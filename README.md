# Foreword by Tristan Bagnulo

In this lesson I implemented to starter Redux app in React that is outlines in the React-Redux quick start tutorial here... https://react-redux.js.org/tutorials/quick-start. A complete explanation of how each of the components work can be found on that page. I chose to follow this guide instead of the lesson-12 YouTube tutorial because some of the functions used in the tutorial were depricated and so the docs seemed like a better single source of truth.

The steps in this lesson were...

SUMMARY
1. Create a Redux store with configureStore
    - configureStore accepts a reducer function as a named argument
    - configureStore automatically sets up the store with good default settings
2. Provide the Redux store to the React application components
    - Put a React Redux <Provider> component around your <App />
    - Pass the Redux store as <Provider store={store}>
3. Create a Redux "slice" reducer with createSlice
    - Call createSlice with a string name, an initial state, and named reducer functions
    - Reducer functions may "mutate" the state using Immer
    - Export the generated slice reducer and action creators
4. Use the React Redux useSelector/useDispatch hooks in React components
    - Read data from the store with the useSelector hook
    - Get the dispatch function with the useDispatch hook, and dispatch actions as needed


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
